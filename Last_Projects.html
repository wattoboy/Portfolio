        <p class="card-text">In groups of two developers, our goal was to create a functioning game or story on the the website scratch.mit.edu, my main roles in this project included brainstorming and coding. I learned how to utilize and expand my programming skills within the scratch programming language. We faced many challenges while working on this project, the biggest being environmental interactions, at first the characters in the game could not interact with each other, but we overcame this by implementing a system that used color coded sensors to allow for the characters to successfully move around and interact in the game environment. As a team of two developers, we split tasks to efficiently complete this project to the maximum quality.</p>

        <p class="card-text">In groups of two developers, our goal was to customize a base application on the the website appinventor.mit.edu, My main roles in this project included brainstorming and coding. I learned how to utilize and expand my programming skills within the Appinventor programming language. We faced many challenges while working on this project, the biggest being the molotov cocktail addon. At first the molotov had many problems. It would either give too many points or too little points. We overcame this by implementing a system that used a timer to only allow the molotov to give the player 15 points which could only be done once. As a team of two developers, we split tasks to efficiently complete this project to the maximum quality.</p>
