   <p class="col-8">My name is Lary, I am a high school student at the Dublin High School located in California. In my education, I have taken part in many activities offered at the school and in the area. For Example, the music program, and the swim teams. One major accomplishment while attending the high school was taking part in the marching band. We set multiple school records and won many awards. Being part of the marching band has taught me skills such as to work as a team and to manage my time.<br><br> Currently, I am enrolled in the Computer Science Principles course. In this course, we are taking lessons in learning the many programming languages including HTML, CSS, and Python. I find that the concepts in the field of computer science are very intriguing.<br><br> Although I may not continue in the path of Computer Science, I plan on continuing studies in other sciences beyond high school and into the future.<br><br> I can be contacted at guo4468@mydusd.org</p>
